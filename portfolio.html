                   <h1> Introducing portfolios for sponsored ads</h1>
                   <p> DECEMBER 18, 2018</p>
                    
                   <p> By Lauren Tran</p>
                    <p>Content Marketing Manager</p>
                    
                   <p> We’re excited to introduce portfolios, a new way to manage and organize your sponsored ads campaigns. Portfolios are designed to simplify your workflow while giving you more control and better insights, letting you focus on improving your campaign performance and running your business.</p>
                    
                   <h1> What is a portfolio?</h1>
                    <p>Portfolios introduce a new management feature that enables you to group and organize Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brands campaigns into collections that mirror the structure of your business. With portfolios, you now have the flexibility to arrange campaigns in a way that’s meaningful for you, such as by brand, product category, or season.</p>
                    
                   <p> You can create a new portfolio in just a few clicks by selecting the campaigns you would like to group together. After creating a portfolio, you can quickly update your portfolio settings with inline edits or bulk sheets.</p>
                    
                   <h2> Portfolio</h2>
                   <p> Leverage these new portfolio features for easier campaign management</p>
                    <p>Control your costs automatically with portfolio budgets</p>
                    
                   <p> A key advantage portfolios offer is control over spend across campaigns. Once your portfolio budget is exhausted, all campaigns in that portfolio will automatically pause until you choose to reactivate them by increasing your portfolio budget.</p>
                    
                   <p> Portfolio budgets can save you time, help you control costs, and remove the need for manual monitoring. Simply set your target budget and let our automated tool alert you when you reach your portfolio-level budget caps or end dates. </p><p>Portfolio budgets can facilitate more efficient campaign planning and management for agencies managing client budgets as well as for vendors managing brand budgets.</p>
                    
                   <h1> Budgets</h1>
                    
                    <p>Evaluate high-level performance across campaigns with portfolio reporting</p>
                    
                   <p> Once you create a portfolio, you will unlock consolidated portfolio reporting in your advertising console. To view this new report, visit the Campaigns tab and click Portfolios to review total spend and total sales for all campaigns within a portfolio and a summary of your overall portfolio spend and sales.</p><p> If you were previously using Excel to manually consolidate reporting across campaigns, this update eliminates the need for this extra work.</p>
                    
                   <h1> Reporting</h1>
                    
                    <p>There are a number of ways you can benefit from portfolio-level reporting:</p>
                    
                    <p>Get a more complete picture of your overall sponsored ads performance organized in a way that’s meaningful to your business.</p>
                    <p>Quickly identify high-level trends that you might not otherwise spot when reviewing individual campaigns.</p>
                    <p>Because you don’t need to manually consolidate data, spend more time analyzing trends and optimizing your campaigns.</p>
                   <p> Simplify your invoice process with new billing statements</p>
                    
                    In addition to creating portfolios, we’ve simplified billing with new statements that are easier to understand. The new billing statement leverages your portfolio structure so you can see how much you spent by brand or product during the billing cycle. These new statements are ready to share with your internal stakeholders or clients without any additional work on your part.

                                <h4 class="portfolio-item-title">Specific</h4>
                                <p class="portfolio-description">Developing specific goals is crucial to ecommerce success. It’s not enough to simply want to increase sales or drive traffic to your site—you need a clear and concise plan to truly make an impact. By identifying precise goals, you can focus on the key areas that move your company forward.</p>

                                <h4 class="portfolio-item-title">Measurable</h4>
                                <p class="portfolio-description">Measurable goals will help you identify which products or services generate the most revenue and which marketing channels yield the best results.

                                    This criterion is essential to reaching success and growth in your business. Without it, you risk losing direction when making critical decisions about the future of your business.</p>

                                <h4 class="portfolio-item-title">Attainable</h4>
                                <p class="portfolio-description">As much as you may dream big and aspire for tremendous success, your ambitions must be realistic. That means understanding your limitations and setting targets that fall within your capabilities.

                                    For instance, if you’re launching a new product line, expecting massive sales from day one may not be feasible. Instead of aiming for the stars immediately, create awareness about your brand and gradually build a loyal customer base.</p>

                                <h4 class="portfolio-item-title">Relevant</h4>
                                <p class="portfolio-description">Goals that don’t resonate with your core beliefs and values will unlikely keep you motivated in the long run. If you want to achieve your dreams, make sure that you set relevant goals that align with your core values.

                                    Every day will feel like another opportunity to progress towards something meaningful rather than a chore or burden. When setbacks occur, you could remind yourself why these goals matter and how they relate to who you are.</p>

                                <h4 class="portfolio-item-title">Time-based</h4>
                                <p class="portfolio-description">A robust timeline can be useful; it provides structure and organization to keep you hyper-focused on what must be done. That way, you won’t feel overwhelmed or discouraged by the enormity of your aspirations. You’ll have a clear roadmap to guide you toward greatness.</p>
